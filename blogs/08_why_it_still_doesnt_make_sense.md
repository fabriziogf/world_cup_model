# Building a World Cup Prediction Model — Part 8: Why It Still Doesn't Make Sense

## Recap

[Part 7](07_fixing_the_favourite.md) ended on a cliffhanger: we'd stopped hand-tuning the model's weights and handed the decision to a backtest, letting Brier score on the 2014/2018/2022 World Cups pick the configuration. The grid search returned its verdict, we baked it in, and ran the final prediction against the official 2026 draw.

Here's what the principled, backtest-validated model produced:

| Rank | Team | Win % |
|------|------|-------|
| 1 | **Japan** | **12.9%** |
| 2 | Morocco | 7.6% |
| 3 | Argentina | 7.5% |
| 4 | Spain | 7.1% |
| 5 | Portugal | 5.2% |
| 6 | Ecuador | 4.8% |
| 7 | Brazil | 4.7% |
| 8 | France | 4.4% |
| 9 | Algeria | 4.1% |
| 10 | Switzerland | 3.7% |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 21 | England | 1.8% |

It is time to be blunt: **this still does not make sense.** And the most important thing we can do is say exactly *why*, because the reasons point directly at what to build next.

## The Reality Check

You don't need to be a statistician to see the problem — you need to be a football fan. Compare the model's top of the table against what any bookmaker, pundit, or supporter would tell you about the favourites for a World Cup:

| | Model says | Football reality |
|---|---|---|
| **Favourite** | Japan (12.9%) | A strong side, but a *clear favourite* over Argentina, France, Spain, Brazil? No serious forecast has ever had Japan first. |
| **Brazil** | 7th, 4.7% | Perennial top-3 contender; 4.7% and behind Ecuador is indefensible. |
| **France** | 8th, 4.4% | 2022 finalists with arguably the deepest squad in the world. |
| **England** | 21st, 1.8% | Euro 2020 *and* 2024 finalists. 21st is absurd. |
| **Algeria** | 9th, 4.1% | A good African side — ahead of Germany, Netherlands, and England? |
| **Ecuador** | 6th, 4.8% | A solid team being rated above Brazil and France. |

The backtest didn't fix the Japan problem — it made it *worse*. Recall from Part 7 that match-importance weighting had been the one thing suppressing Japan (it lifted Morocco and Argentina). The backtest found that importance weighting **hurts** predictive accuracy and switched it off — which let Japan climb back to the top, *higher* than before.

That's the crucial clue. When the most rigorous, data-driven version of your model endorses the least plausible answer, the problem is not the tuning. **The problem is the model.**

## Why the Model Believes This

### 1. Dixon-Coles only sees goals

The entire model reduces each team to two numbers — an attack rating and a defense rating — fitted purely from goals scored and conceded. It has no concept of a possession-dominant 1-0 win, a heroic goalless draw away to a giant, a depleted squad, or a meaningless dead-rubber. A team that *runs up the score* looks strong; a team that *wins efficiently* looks ordinary.

- **Japan** scores freely and concedes little, including genuinely great results (they beat Germany and Spain at the 2022 World Cup). The model has no way to discount the inflation from a schedule full of AFC opponents beyond a single crude confederation multiplier.
- **England** grind out cautious 1-0 wins. A goals-hungry model systematically *underrates* low-scoring winners — hence 21st.
- **Brazil** get dragged down by CONMEBOL's brutal 10-team round-robin qualifier, where even the best teams draw and lose regularly. Those results now count at full weight, and the model reads a 0-0 in La Paz as evidence of weakness rather than a normal night in South American qualifying.

### 2. A single strength axis can't capture "who you beat"

Confederation weighting was our attempt at a strength-of-schedule correction, and it *did* help — but only at the coarsest possible granularity. Within a confederation, the model still treats thrashing the weakest team identically to beating the strongest. There is no opponent-by-opponent adjustment, because a two-parameter generative model simply has nowhere to put that information.

### 3. The metric we optimised is nearly blind to the thing we care about

This is the subtle, uncomfortable one. We tuned for **Brier score on individual match outcomes**, and we "improved" it by 2.3%. But match-outcome Brier is dominated by the *many* lopsided group games (favourite crushes minnow), where almost any reasonable model scores well. The identity of the eventual *champion* is a tiny, high-variance signal buried in that average.

So a configuration can post the best Brier score while still ranking the wrong team first. **Optimising match calibration does not optimise the champion ranking** — and we were quietly hoping it would. It didn't, and it was never going to. A better evaluation would score the model on its tournament-level output (e.g. log-loss against actual World Cup finishes), not just per-match outcomes.

### 4. Reweighting a bad axis is still a bad axis

Everything we did in Parts 6 and 7 — importance weighting, confederation weighting, backtest tuning — reweighted *which matches* inform the fit. None of it changed *what the model measures*. We kept polishing a single goals-based number. You can weight the inputs perfectly and still get a poor answer if the feature itself is too thin to express team strength.

## What This Tells Us To Build

The diagnosis writes the prescription. We need (a) a strength signal that is opponent-adjusted by construction, and (b) a model that can combine *many* features instead of one. The project already has both pieces designed:

### Elo — opponent-adjusted by construction

The [Elo system](../src/elo.py) doesn't care how many goals you score; it cares *whom you beat*. Every result transfers rating points between the two teams in proportion to how surprising the outcome was, weighted by match importance. Strength of schedule is baked in automatically through the chain of results: beating a 1900-rated side earns far more than thrashing a 1300-rated one, with no hand-set confederation table required. Elo would rate Brazil, France, and England far more sensibly than a goals-based generative model — and it's already built, tested, and sitting unused in the prediction path.

### XGBoost — many features, learned weights

The [feature pipeline](02_feature_engineering.md) from Part 2 was built for exactly this moment. Instead of a single attack/defense number, an XGBoost classifier can learn from:

- `elo_diff` — the opponent-adjusted strength gap
- `form_home` / `form_away` — recent results, exponentially weighted
- `rest_days` — fixture congestion
- `h2h_home_winrate` — historical matchups
- `tournament_weight`, `is_neutral` — context

A gradient-boosted model *learns* how to weight these from data, rather than us guessing multipliers. Crucially, it can discover that Elo difference matters far more than raw goal totals — the exact correction our Dixon-Coles model can't make.

### And a better way to judge it

When we wire the ensemble in, we should evaluate it not only on per-match Brier but on its **tournament-level** sanity: does the champion ranking pass the football-fan smell test, and how does it score against the *actual* winners of 2014/2018/2022? The [evaluator](03_evaluation_and_calibration.md) gives us the backtesting harness; we just need to point it at the right target.

## The Honest Takeaway

We built a pipeline that is fast (Part 5), correct in structure (Part 6), properly tested (Part 4), and rigorously tuned (Part 7). Every piece of engineering is sound. And it still confidently tells us Japan will win the World Cup ahead of Brazil, France, and England.

That is not a failure — it's the most valuable result in the whole series. It demonstrates, cleanly, that **good engineering and principled tuning cannot rescue a model whose core feature is too weak.** No amount of reweighting goals will teach a model that England's cautious 1-0 wins are worth more than Japan's flattering goal difference. For that, you need a different signal entirely.

So we stop tuning, and we change the model. Next: the Elo + XGBoost ensemble — and a real test of whether a richer feature set finally produces a favourite you'd actually put money on.
