# Building a World Cup Prediction Model — Part 10: The Final Prediction, and Measuring What Matters

## The prediction

After nine parts of building, breaking, and rebuilding, here is the model's final forecast for the 2026 World Cup — the Elo + gradient-boosted-trees ensemble, fit on 49,411 international matches and run through 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations of the official 48-team draw.

| Rank | Team | Win % | Reach final | Reach semis |
|------|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Argentina** | 17.1% | 25.1% | 35.7% |
| 2 | Spain | 12.8% | 19.7% | 29.5% |
| 3 | France | 8.9% | 15.4% | 25.2% |
| 4 | Brazil | 6.7% | 12.3% | 21.5% |
| 5 | England | 4.8% | 9.7% | 18.3% |
| 6 | Portugal | 4.8% | 9.6% | 18.1% |
| 7 | Germany | 3.4% | 7.4% | 15.2% |
| 8 | Japan | 3.3% | 7.0% | 14.4% |
| 9 | Uruguay | 3.2% | 6.8% | 13.9% |
| 10 | Netherlands | 3.1% | 6.6% | 14.0% |

The reigning champions, Argentina, are the favourites at 17.1%, clear of Spain and France. Brazil, England, Portugal, and Germany round out a top seven that any football fan would recognise as *the contenders*. The full table runs all the way down to Curaçao at 0.004%.

*(A confession from the author, typed through gritted teeth: I am Brazilian, and after ten parts of painstaking work my own model has the audacity to put **Argentina** first and Brazil a distant fourth. I re-ran it. Several times. The seed didn't care about my feelings. Some biases, it turns out, you cannot vectorize away.)*

A few things worth noting beyond the headline:

- **It's a wide-open field.** Even the favourite wins only about one time in six. A 17% favourite means Argentina fails to lift the trophy in roughly five of every six simulated tournaments — exactly the uncertainty a knockout tournament deserves.
- **Group J is Argentina's launchpad.** Argentina has a 91.5% chance of escaping its group, the highest in the field.
- **The toughest "big" group is E** — Germany (86.6% to advance) and Ecuador (83.4%) are strong, but Ivory Coast (69.2%) makes it genuinely competitive.
- **Dark horses:** Mexico (2.9%), Colombia (2.9%), Morocco (2.8%), and Croatia (2.6%) all carry real semi-final equity without being household favourites.

If you've read [Part 6](06_the_prediction.md), you'll feel the difference immediately. That first prediction crowned Japan and buried England in 21st. This one needs no apology. But the more interesting story isn't *what* the model now predicts — it's *how we know it's better*. That turned out to be the hardest problem in the whole project.

## Measuring what matters

Here is the uncomfortable truth running underneath this series: **for most of it, we were measuring the wrong thing — and the measurement told us we were doing fine.**

Our primary metric was Brier score on individual match outcomes. It's a perfectly respectable metric. It's also, for a *tournament* model, almost the wrong one. Watch how it behaved at each stage:

| Improvement | What per-match Brier said |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Backtest-tuned weights (Part 7) | +2.3% |
| Elo + XGBoost ensemble (Part 9) | +3.5% |

Modest, incremental, unremarkable. If you were judging the project on per-match Brier, you'd conclude the ensemble was a minor upgrade — a few percent, with an outright loss on 2014. You might not bother shipping it.

Now here is the *same* ensemble, measured on what we actually care about — the probability it assigned to the teams that genuinely reached the final stages of the 2014, 2018, and 2022 World Cups:

| Metric (averaged over three World Cups) | Dixon-Coles | Ensemble |
|------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| Probability on the actual champion | 4.9% | **14.6%** |
| Average rank of the actual champion | 7.7th | **3.3rd** |
| Champion log-loss | 3.07 | **2.06** |

Three times the probability on the real winner. The actual champions — Germany 2014, Argentina 2022 — went from being buried at 8th and 11th in the Dixon-Coles table to sitting 2nd in the ensemble's. That is not a 3.5% improvement. That is a different class of model.

**Both numbers describe the same two models on the same tournaments.** The only thing that changed was the question we asked.

### Why the gap exists

Per-match Brier is an average over every match in a tournament. The overwhelming majority of those are group games, and most group games are lopsided — a contender against a minnow, where any sane model already predicts the favourite at 80-90%. Get all of those roughly right and your Brier looks fine no matter how badly you rank the eventual champion. The handful of matches that actually decide the trophy are a rounding error in the average.

So a model can be excellent at the easy, plentiful predictions and hopeless at the few hard, important ones, and per-match Brier will barely flinch. It rewarded the Dixon-Coles model for confidently beating up on group-stage minnows while it quietly rated Japan above Brazil.

### The lesson

This is Goodhart's law in miniature: *when a measure becomes the target, it stops being a good measure.* We spent Parts 6 and 7 optimising weight multipliers against per-match Brier, dutifully improving it by 2.3% — while the thing we cared about, the champion ranking, stayed broken. The metric was green. The model was wrong. We only caught it because the output was *so* implausible (Japan first) that no metric could paper over it.

The fix wasn't a better model — that came later. The fix was a better **question**. Once we scored the models on champion probability ([`src/tournaments.py`](../src/tournaments.py)), the ranking and the metric finally agreed, and the ensemble's true margin — 3× — became visible.

The discipline that matters, in this project and well beyond it: **build the evaluation that measures your actual goal, not the one that's convenient to compute.** A per-match metric was easy; it was also misleading. The tournament-level metric took real work — hardcoding historical brackets, simulating each one, scoring against reality — and it was the only one that told the truth.

## Honest caveats on the final number

In the spirit of the whole series, the prediction comes with its asterisks:

- **The model has no squad-level information.** Injuries, form slumps, a manager change, a golden generation aging out — none of it is visible. The model sees only results.
- **The backtest is three tournaments deep.** The ensemble's tournament-level win is large and consistent on 2014 and 2022, but it *lost* the per-match Brier comparison on 2014 and was roughly level with Dixon-Coles on 2018's champion. Three World Cups is a small sample.
- **17% is genuine uncertainty, not a hedge.** The favourite misses far more often than it wins. Treat the whole table as a distribution, not a tip.
- **The group draw is current as of the final 2026 allocation** (with the playoff qualifiers resolved). The simulator uses standard strength-based seeding for the Round of 32, an approximation of FIFA's fixed bracket chart.

## The arc

Ten parts ago this was an Elo class and a Poisson model. Along the way it became a study in honest engineering: a 10-hour fit cut to 10 seconds by changing the *shape* of a computation, not the hardware; a favourite that survived every principled tuning attempt until we changed the model itself; and a metric that flattered us until we replaced it with one that didn't.

The model now says Argentina, then Spain, then France. You can believe that or not — it's a model, with all a model's blind spots. But for the first time in the project, the number and the method behind it can both look you in the eye.

And the most durable lesson has nothing to do with football: **a model is only as trustworthy as the question you use to judge it.** Measure the thing you care about. If that's hard to measure, that difficulty is the work — not an excuse to measure something easier instead.
