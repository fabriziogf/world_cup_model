# Building a World Cup Prediction Model — Part 4: Testing the Models

## Recap

Over the first three parts of this series we built the full predictive pipeline:

- **[Part 1](01_building_the_simulator.md)** — the Monte Carlo tournament simulator
- **[Part 2](02_feature_engineering.md)** — the feature engineering pipeline
- **[Part 3](03_evaluation_and_calibration.md)** — the backtesting and calibration framework

Every one of those modules came with an ad-hoc smoke test — a one-off script to confirm "yes, it runs and the numbers look sane." That's fine for initial development, but it doesn't protect against regressions. The moment someone tweaks a K-factor or refactors the bracket seeding, those smoke tests are gone and nothing catches the break.

**Part 4** turns those informal checks into a permanent, automated safety net: a `pytest` suite that runs in seconds and verifies the mathematical guarantees each model is supposed to uphold.

## Testing Philosophy for Statistical Models

Testing probabilistic models is different from testing ordinary application code. You usually can't assert exact output values — a Monte Carlo simulation gives slightly different numbers every run, and a fitted model's parameters depend on optimisation details.

Instead, you test the **invariants** — the properties that must hold no matter what:

- **Structural invariants** — probabilities sum to 1, score matrices normalise, every team appears exactly once
- **Directional invariants** — a stronger team must have a higher win probability than a weaker one; a higher-stakes match must move ratings more than a friendly
- **Conservation laws** — Elo is zero-sum, so total points in the system never change
- **Boundary behaviour** — edge cases like the Dixon-Coles tau correction return exact, known values

These hold regardless of the random seed or the exact fitted parameters, which makes them reliable test targets.

## `test_elo.py` — Rating Dynamics

The Elo system is deterministic, so these tests can assert precise behaviour.

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `test_teams_initialise_at_base_rating` | Unseen teams start at 1500 |
| `test_single_match_first_appearance_starts_from_base` | Pre-match ratings of a debut match are both 1500 |
| `test_winner_gains_loser_loses` | A decisive result moves the winner up, loser down |
| `test_draw_between_equal_teams_no_change` | Equal teams drawing at a neutral venue stay put |
| `test_total_elo_is_constant` | **Zero-sum**: total system Elo equals `n_teams × 1500` |
| `test_higher_k_produces_larger_swing` | A World Cup match (K=60) moves ratings more than a friendly (K=10) |
| `test_predict_probabilities_sum_to_one` | `predict()` home/draw/away probabilities sum to 1 |
| `test_stronger_team_higher_win_prob` | A team with several wins is favoured over its victims |

The zero-sum test is the most important — it's the mathematical heart of Elo. If a refactor ever broke the symmetry of the rating update (winner gains exactly what the loser drops), this test catches it immediately:

```python
def test_total_elo_is_constant(simple_matches):
    elo = EloSystem()
    elo.compute_ratings(simple_matches)
    total = sum(elo.ratings.values())
    n_teams = len(elo.ratings)
    assert total == pytest.approx(n_teams * BASE_RATING)
```

## `test_poisson.py` — The Scoreline Model

The Dixon-Coles model is fitted via maximum likelihood, which is the slow part of the suite. To keep things fast, the fitted model is built **once** as a module-scoped fixture and shared across all nine tests:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def fitted_model():
    # 4 teams, engineered strengths, ~180 synthetic matches
    ...
    model = DixonColes(time_decay=0)
    model.fit(df)
    return model
```

The synthetic data is generated with known latent strengths (Brazil > Germany > France > Chile), which lets us assert the model *recovers* that ordering:

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `test_fit_runs_and_sets_params` | Fitting populates attack, defense, home_adv, rho |
| `test_score_matrix_sums_to_one` | The scoreline matrix normalises to ~1.0 |
| `test_score_matrix_is_nonnegative` | No negative probabilities |
| `test_predict_outcome_probabilities_sum_to_one` | Home/draw/away sum to ~1 |
| `test_predict_knockout_sums_to_one` | Draw mass split so two win probs sum to ~1 |
| `test_stronger_team_higher_win_probability` | Brazil beats Chile more often than the reverse |
| `test_strength_ordering_recovered` | Fitted net strengths preserve Brazil > Chile |
| `test_tau_edge_cases` | The Dixon-Coles correction returns exact values |
| `test_predict_unfitted_raises` | Predicting before fitting raises a clear error |

The tau correction test is a good example of testing exact boundary behaviour. The Dixon-Coles low-score adjustment has a precise closed form for each of the four corrected scorelines, so we assert them directly:

```python
def test_tau_edge_cases():
    lam, mu, rho = 1.5, 1.2, -0.1
    assert DixonColes._tau(lam, mu, 0, 0, rho) == pytest.approx(1 - lam * mu * rho)
    assert DixonColes._tau(lam, mu, 1, 0, rho) == pytest.approx(1 + mu * rho)
    assert DixonColes._tau(lam, mu, 0, 1, rho) == pytest.approx(1 + lam * rho)
    assert DixonColes._tau(lam, mu, 1, 1, rho) == pytest.approx(1 - rho)
    assert DixonColes._tau(lam, mu, 2, 3, rho) == 1.0   # no correction
```

---

## `test_simulate.py` — The Bracket Simulator

Testing the simulator posed a performance problem: it needs a fitted Dixon-Coles model covering all 32 teams, and fitting that via MLE on a full round-robin would take minutes — far too slow for a test suite.

The solution was to **bypass the fit entirely and inject hand-crafted parameters**. The simulator only ever reads `params_`, `teams_`, and `is_fitted_`, so we can construct a model with engineered attack/defense values directly:

```python
def _engineered_model() -> DixonColes:
    model = DixonColes()
    # All teams neutral, except a dominant favourite and a weak outsider
    attack[FAVOURITE]  = 1.2;  defense[FAVOURITE]  = -1.2
    attack[OUTSIDER]   = -1.2; defense[OUTSIDER]   = 1.2
    model.teams_ = sorted(ALL_TEAMS)
    model.params_ = {"attack": attack, "defense": defense, "home_adv": 0.1, "rho": -0.1}
    model.is_fitted_ = True
    return model
```

This makes the simulator tests both **fast** and **deterministic** (via a fixed seed), while still exercising the full bracket logic — group stage, knockout seeding, and probability aggregation.

| Test | What it verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `test_win_probabilities_sum_to_one` | Exactly one champion per sim → p_win sums to 1 |
| `test_stage_sums_are_consistent` | Stage sums are 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 / 16 (final/semi/QF/R16/group exit) |
| `test_all_teams_present` | Every bracket team appears exactly once |
| `test_probabilities_in_valid_range` | All probabilities within [0, 1] |
| `test_favourite_wins_more_than_outsider` | The strong team wins more than the weak one |
| `test_favourite_is_top_ranked` | The favourite is the single most likely champion |
| `test_mid_tournament_update_changes_probabilities` | A team that loses all group games collapses to 0% |
| `test_known_result_respected_in_group` | A team handed 9 points reliably advances (>90%) |

The mid-tournament test is the most valuable — it validates the `simulate_from_current()` feature that lets the model update live as results come in. By feeding in three group-stage losses for the favourite, we confirm its championship probability drops to exactly zero (it can't advance), while the baseline simulation gives it the highest odds:

```python
def test_mid_tournament_update_changes_probabilities():
    baseline = sim.simulate(GROUPS)
    # Brazil loses all three group matches 0-3
    updated = sim.simulate_from_current(GROUPS, results_so_far)
    assert p_fav_updated < p_fav_baseline
    assert p_fav_updated == pytest.approx(0.0, abs=1e-9)
```

## Lessons From Writing These Tests

**Inject, don't fit.** When the expensive part of a system (here, MLE fitting) isn't what you're testing, construct the object's state directly. The simulator tests run in seconds because they never touch the optimiser.

**Test invariants, not values.** You can't assert "Brazil wins 18.3% of the time" — that's seed-dependent. But you *can* assert "Brazil wins more than Tonga" and "all probabilities sum to 1." Those hold forever.

**Seed everything random.** Every simulator test passes a fixed `seed`, so a failure is reproducible rather than a flaky once-in-ten event.

**Share expensive fixtures.** The module-scoped `fitted_model` fixture fits the Dixon-Coles model once and reuses it across nine tests, instead of paying the fit cost nine times.

## The Project, Complete

With the test suite in place, all four modules from the original task breakdown are built, verified, and on `main`:

```
✅ src/elo.py         — Elo ratings           (stable)
✅ src/poisson.py     — Dixon-Coles model     (stable)
✅ src/simulate.py    — tournament simulator   + tests
✅ src/features.py    — feature pipeline
✅ src/evaluate.py    — backtesting & calibration
✅ tests/             — 25 passing tests
```

The foundation is now solid enough to build on with confidence. The natural next step is the **XGBoost prediction layer** that consumes the `FeatureBuilder` output — and when that lands, it'll come with its own tests, validated against the same Brier-score backtests from Part 3.
